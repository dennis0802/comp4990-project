# Game Development Project for COMP4990 - Project Management: Techniques and Tools

# Game Name: The Western Trail (working name)

This game development project simulates a survival environment where the user must survive from a starting 
location to a goal location, with branching paths they can choose along the way. Depending on the chosen path, the 
environment, dangers, and distance travelled will change, allowing for replay value. Additional features supporting 
the replay value are player-made characters which will be stored in a database and different modes such as standard 
difficulty, custom characters, and hard mode. The game will also support up to four different save files for the 
player.

Players must carefully manage their resources and possibly their team of up to 4 AI-controlled companions while 
surviving three major phases that iterate during the game – a travel phase where resource consumption and events 
may occur during travel from A to B, a combat phase where the player must survive for x amount of time against 
enemy AI before being able to escape, and a rest phase where the player can heal up their team and manage 
resources. If the player fails to manage their resources and survive combat sections, they will not make it to the 
finish area. Otherwise, the player’s final score and game statistics are displayed. In all phases, every time a major 
action is done, the game is autosaved to lock in the player’s choice.

The purpose is to deliver a polished game from design specifications and building it into a fun game with replay 
value for end-users, a regular goal for most game development projects. With a single developer, the project will be 
done during 2023, where milestones will be set throughout the year to have designs and components of the game 
done by a certain time, and the final deadline is by the end of the year to present the final product. This project’s 
success will be measured by interest in the final product, how efficient it can run, the replay value, and how 
immersive the game environment is to end-users.
